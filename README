This is an Android app for displaying data from the University of
Waterloo's weather station. See http://weather.uwaterloo.ca .

This is both a widget that can run on your home screen, as well as
an app that simply reads the current settings off the web page, and
display it.

The app is not sophisticated: it was written to learn a bit about
Android programming in Java, and may be useful for others wishing
to do the same.
